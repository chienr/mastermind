# MasterMind

## Intro
I wrote this little game for my kids. It's not much, just over 100 lines of Python (including tests!) and only runs in command line. They love it. :)

The game is based on the classic two-player board game MasterMind which I played when I was around their age. To keep it simple, the six colors are represented by digits 1-6 instead. The game randomly makes a secret code and the player tries to guess the correct code with as few tries as possible.

## Usage
To run, just do:

1. python mastermind.py

If you do not have access to a Terminal, the [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) website provides a super easy way. Just create an account, upload mastermind.py, and run it in the bash console.

## TODO
While the game works, it's very basic. Older (10+) kids might take interest in modifying the code to add more bells and whistles, such as:

1. Limit the number of tries for the codebreaker.
2. Add a time limit.
